# 🎲 Board Game Framework – C++ OOP Project

> 📜 **Disclaimer:** This project was created as part of a collaborative academic assignment. I contributed to several game variants within the framework, but I am not the sole developer of the entire system.

## 🧠 Overview

A modular and extensible board game framework built in C++ to showcase Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. Designed to allow easy creation of new board game types without modifying the core logic.


---

## 🧩 Key Features

- **Game Manager** – Handles gameplay loop, player turns, and outcome detection  
- **Abstract Board** – Core structure for any board-based game  
- **Abstract Player** – Extendable class representing a player in any game  
- **Random Player** – Computer-controlled player with random valid moves  
- **Extensible Design** – Add new games by extending base classes

## 🎮 Games Built Using This Framework

The project currently supports a variety of classic and creative games, including:

1. **Pyramid Tic-Tac-Toe** – Played on a 5-3-1 shaped pyramid board  
2. **Four-in-a-Row** – Similar to Connect Four  
3. **5x5 Tic-Tac-Toe** – Players have 12 moves each; win by creating the most 3-in-a-rows ✅ *(contributed)*  
4. **Word Tic-Tac-Toe** – Form valid words using letters on a 3x3 board  
5. **Numerical Tic-Tac-Toe** – Use numbers to make 15 across a row/column/diagonal  
6. **Misère Tic-Tac-Toe** – Avoid making 3 in a row — or you lose ✅ *(contributed)*  
7. **4x4 Tic-Tac-Toe** – Move tokens to align three on a 4x4 grid  
8. **Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe** – A meta-game with 9 boards making up one master board ✅ *(partial contribution)*  
9. **SUS Game** – Form the word "S-U-S" in any direction ✅ *(partial contribution)*
